== Ruby Docz 2

Small toy I built to play around with Nokogiri and JQuery UI (autocomplete), along with having and easier way to reference Ruby Docs.  Heroku: enigmatic-chamber-1400.herokuapp.com

Future plans: 
- Some data is bad due to inconsistencies of DOM structures on ruby-doc.org pages.  I'd like to clean this data up a bit. 
- Optimize for mobile.
